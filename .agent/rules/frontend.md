- This is a react 19 codebase
- Use `bun` and `bunx` commands to handle tests, builds, installs
- Styles are handled with shadcn, use the CLI tool to add new components
- Components should just render data. Anything that involves using hooks and fetching data should be considered a feature
- When working on features look to abstract specific generic logic to its own components
- Keep constants, types, and utilities in separate files
